Use one or both as needed.\n\nNote that you must create the appropriate config files before starting\nthe services or dhcpd will refuse to run.\n  DHCPv4: /home/tim/.linuxbrew/etc/dhcpd.conf\n  DHCPv6: /home/tim/.linuxbrew/etc/dhcpd6.conf\n\nSample config files may be found in /home/tim/.linuxbrew/etc.\n",
